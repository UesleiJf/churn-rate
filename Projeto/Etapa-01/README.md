### Description of Part-01

The first part of the project consists of: handling all data (filtering valid data, analyzing possible null data); do analysis of standard deviation, maximum and minimum, mean, and ultimately generate graphs for an overview of how data is distributed.

This analysis is done on two types of groups: one that has the status = ACTIVE column and one that has the status = CANCELED.
