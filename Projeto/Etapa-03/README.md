### Description of Part-03

In the third part of the project we will create an API for predictive analysis of customer sent data, to make this API available we will create a docker container (https://docs.docker.com/).

Practical example:

- Through a browser, the client passes information to the API and receives a prediction response that was made by the algorithm: ACTIVE status or CANCELED status (the value of this result tells the prediction of which group it belongs to).

- Algorithm analysis will use a CSV file with the test base to return the result.

- Insert CSV your file into "Etapa-03/data" directory
