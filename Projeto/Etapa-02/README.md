### Description of Part-02

The second part of the project is to analyze the accuracy and runtime of Machine Learning algorithms. For this analysis 4 algorithms were chosen: Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression.
At the end of exhaustive testing, the algorithm chosen for the implementation of phase 03 was the Random Forest.
