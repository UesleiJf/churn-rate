# Description

This project aims to: analyze a database and through Machine Learning algorithms make assertive predictions for decision making.

Algorithms used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Naive Bayes and Gradient Boosting.

The project is divided into 3 parts:
- Static Analysis
- Choice of the best algorithm for problem solving
- Creating a Container Docker for use via client (entering data to see the forecast). Para executar essa parte do projeto veja o arquivo README.md da Part03.
